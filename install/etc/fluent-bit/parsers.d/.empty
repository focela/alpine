# Placeholder File - Intentionally Empty
#
# Purpose: This file serves as a directory placeholder to ensure this location
#          exists in version control and deployment processes. It may also serve
#          as a template location for future initialization scripts or configuration.
#
# Context: Part of s6-overlay container initialization structure
# Project: Container Infrastructure - Focela
# 
# Note: If you need to add initialization scripts or configuration to this
#       location, replace this file with your implementation following the
#       established patterns in the adjacent initialization scripts.
