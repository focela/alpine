include:

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers also have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They may also ban contributors
temporarily or permanently for inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or
harmful behaviors.

an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include:

- Using an official project e-mail address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at events

Project maintainers may define additional rules or clarify existing
representation responsibilities as needed.

## Enforcement

reported by contacting the project team at oss-conduct@focela.com. The team
will:

1. Review and investigate all complaints.
2. Respond in a way deemed appropriate to the circumstances.
3. Maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of the incident.

Further enforcement details may be posted separately. Project maintainers who
fail to follow or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face
temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the project leadership.
